***The following code is for a web crawler that can perform different actions throughout instagram.***

This web crawler uses selenium and is designed to scroll through instagram, find and message accounts based on certain hashtags, message an inputted list of many instagram accounts, and  like and comment on posts. This web crawler deal with various pop up dialogues while logging into instagram. It will also detect if a message has already been sent to an account and it will not message the same account twice. This feature is intended to reduce inappropriate spam. 

This web crawler requires selenium and chrome driver. This web crawler works specifically with google chrome due to the web driver setup. This code will start an active browser dialogue on your native computer.

The data cleaning notebook is run on a large list of music accounts on instagram. I cleaned and used this data as a demo of the capabilities of this web crawler when messaging a list of inputted accounts. As mentioned above, this web crawler can also message accounts, comment on photos, and like posts using only a hashtag as an input.

**This bot is designed as a demonstration of web crawling and is not intended to be used to spam accounts. I recommend running this bot with less than 15 actions or less at a time in order to be respectful of other users.**
